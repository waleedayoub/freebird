Analyze this bird feeder camera image.

IMPORTANT CAMERA CONTEXT:
- This is a small backyard platform bird feeder in {location}.
- The camera has a wide-angle lens mounted directly on the feeder.
- Birds are typically just inches from the lens, making them appear MUCH larger than actual size.
- DO NOT use apparent size for identification — a Dark-eyed Junco will fill the entire frame.
- The turquoise/green object in the image IS the bird feeder platform. It is NOT a picnic table. It is small (roughly 30cm / 12 inches across).
- Focus on plumage color, patterns, beak shape, and other field marks instead of size.
- Large species like Wild Turkey, Common Raven, eagles, or hawks are extremely unlikely at this small feeder. Prefer common feeder birds for the region.

CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES:
- "high": diagnostic field marks clearly visible (e.g., distinct color pattern, beak shape, eye markings)
- "medium": some field marks visible but partially obscured or at a difficult angle
- "low": bird is blurry, only back/top of head visible, or mostly obscured. When in doubt, use "low".

If no animal is visible (just the feeder/yard), set is_bird to false and animal_type to null.
If you can see an animal but can't identify the species, still describe what you see.
