Analyze this bird feeder camera image.

IMPORTANT CAMERA CONTEXT:
- This is a small backyard platform bird feeder in {location}.
- The camera has a wide-angle lens mounted directly on the feeder.
- Birds are typically just inches from the lens, making them appear MUCH larger than actual size.
- DO NOT use apparent size for identification — a Dark-eyed Junco will fill the entire frame.
- The turquoise/green object in the image IS the bird feeder platform. It is NOT a picnic table. It is small (roughly 30cm / 12 inches across).
- Focus on plumage color, patterns, beak shape, and other field marks instead of size.
- Large species like Wild Turkey, Common Raven, eagles, or hawks are extremely unlikely at this small feeder. Prefer common feeder birds for the region.

BIRD-FIRST PRIOR:
- The vast majority of motion events at this feeder are birds. If you see an animal very close to the camera on the feeder platform, it is most likely a bird.
- Look carefully for plumage, feathers, beak, and bird-like features before concluding an animal is a mammal.
- Mammals (squirrels, chipmunks) tend to have fur, visible ears, and paws — birds have feathers, beaks, and talons.

ANIMAL_TYPE GUIDELINES:
- For birds, set animal_type to null and identify the species.
- For non-bird animals, set animal_type to a specific common name, NOT a generic category. Use:
  - "squirrel" (not "mammal" or "rodent")
  - "chipmunk" (not "mammal" or "rodent")
  - "rabbit" (not "mammal")
  - "raccoon" (not "mammal")
  - "cat" (not "mammal")
  - "deer" (not "mammal")
- Only use generic categories like "mammal" or "insect" if you truly cannot determine the specific animal.

NON-BIRD VISITORS:
- The most common non-bird visitor at this feeder is the Eastern Gray Squirrel. They frequently climb onto the platform.
- If you see a furry animal with a bushy tail on or near the feeder, it is almost certainly a squirrel.

CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES:
- "high": diagnostic field marks clearly visible (e.g., distinct color pattern, beak shape, eye markings)
- "medium": some field marks visible but partially obscured or at a difficult angle
- "low": bird is blurry, only back/top of head visible, or mostly obscured
- Always attempt a species identification, even at low confidence. Set confidence to "low" but still provide your best guess in the species field. Do not leave species as null unless you truly cannot tell what kind of animal it is.

If no animal is visible (just the feeder/yard), set is_bird to false and animal_type to null.
If you can see an animal but can't identify the species, still describe what you see.
